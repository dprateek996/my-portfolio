If the Stripe configuration is missing (e.g., in local development or self-hosted instances), the Stripe API throws an unhandled error, causing the entire team deletion process to abort before the team is removed from the database.\r\n\r\nThe Fix:\r\n\r\nSafe Error Handling: Wrapped the Stripe cancellation logic in a try/catch block.\r\n\r\nGraceful Degradation: If Stripe fails, the error is logged, but the function continues to delete memberships and the team from the database.\r\n\r\nType Safety: Cleaned up imports and resolved the \"Type check\" failures mentioned by reviewers.\r\n\r\nEvidence:\r\n\r\nBefore (Crash/Data persists): \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a10562d-8ba7-467a-8a24-0da005317aca\r\n\r\nAfter (Successful deletion): \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a06dc44-a7cb-486c-9064-75d3ecc973f7\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, this check is unnecessary because the code already throws a `TRPCError` immediately above (lines 72-74) if `parseTeams.success` is false.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Refactor:** Removed ternary operator in favor of direct property access (`parseTeams.data`), as `success` is guaranteed to be true at this point of execution.\r\n\r\n## How to Test\r\n1. Open `packages/trpc/server/routers/viewer/organizations/createTeams.handler.ts`.\r\n2. Observe that TypeScript correctly infers `parseTeams.data` exists without the additional check.\r\n3. Verify that the logic remains functionally identical (this is a non-breaking code cleanup).",

Since the code explicitly throws an error there if !parseTeams.success, we can’t actually reach line 76 unless the parsing was successful.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like dead code to me, but I'm totally happy to put it back if you prefer having the extra safety check.",

        "body": "## Describe the bug\n\nOn self-hosted Cal.com instances, any profile update (including during onboarding) fails with a 500 Internal Server Error because the Stripe SDK is initialized at module load time, crashing when `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set.\n\n**Error message:**\n```\nSTRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY is not set\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe bug is in `packages/features/ee/payments/server/stripe.ts` (lines 8-12):\n\n```typescript\nconst stripe =\n  globalThis.stripe ||\n  new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY!, {  // ← Crashes if undefined\n    apiVersion: \"2020-08-27\",\n  });\n```\n\n**Import chain that triggers the crash:**\n1. `updateProfile.handler.ts` imports `StripeBillingService` (line 7)\n2. `StripeBillingService` imports `stripe` from `@calcom/features/ee/payments/server/stripe`\n3. That module immediately executes `new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY!, ...)`\n4. Since `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` is undefined, Stripe SDK throws the error\n\n**Key insight:** The error occurs during module import, NOT during any business logic. ANY profile update will fail on self-hosted instances without `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`, regardless of username or other factors.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Deploy Cal.com self-hosted (tested on Railway using official template)\n2. Do NOT set `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable\n3. Create a new user account\n4. During onboarding, try to proceed past Step 1\n5. **Result**: 500 Internal Server Error with \"STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY is not set\"\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nSelf-hosted instances without Stripe configuration should:\n- Not import/initialize Stripe SDK when it's not needed\n- Or handle the missing key gracefully without crashing\n\n## Workaround\n\nSet a placeholder value for `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`:\n```bash\nSTRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=sk_test_placeholder_for_selfhosted\n```\n\nThis allows the module to load. Actual Stripe API calls will fail, but self-hosted users typically don't need Stripe functionality.\n\n## Suggested fix\n\nLazy-initialize the Stripe instance:\n\n```typescript\nlet _stripe: Stripe | null = null;\n\nexport function getStripe(): Stripe {\n  if (!process.env.STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY) {\n    throw new Error(\"STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY is not configured\");\n  }\n  if (!_stripe) {\n    _stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY, {\n      apiVersion: \"2020-08-27\",\n    });\n  }\n  return _stripe;\n}\n```\n\nOr conditionally import billing services only when Stripe is configured.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Deployment**: Railway (official template)\n- **Cal.com version**: Latest (Docker image `calcom/cal.com`)\n- **Self-hosted**: Yes\n- **Stripe configured**: No (not using payments)\n\n## Files involved\n\n- `packages/features/ee/payments/server/stripe.ts` - **Bug location**\n- `packages/features/ee/billing/stripe-billing-service.ts` - Imports stripe module\n- `packages/trpc/server/routers/viewer/me/updateProfile.handler.ts` - Imports billing service",

Destructive actions (like delete) should use the destructive color to clearly indicate their nature and improve visual hierarchy.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to the workflows page (/workflows)\n2. View the workflow list with at least one workflow\n3. Observe the delete button (trash icon) in the desktop view\n\n### Actual Results\n\n<img width=\"168\" height=\"156\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da7beb61-9774-423f-bc4c-6c2385501202\" />\n\n### Expected Results\n\n<img width=\"147\" height=\"149\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5fdb4f2-1824-41c7-b78d-c23fdeda8849\" />\n",
